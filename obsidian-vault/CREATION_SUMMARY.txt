GRAPH VISUALIZATION
===================

When opened in Obsidian's Graph View, this creates:

- 149 nodes (files)
- Wiki-link connections between trilogies and movies
- Natural force-directed layout grouping related concepts
- Tag-based filtering options (#trilogy, #movie, #shared-movie)

Connection Types:
1. Trilogy → Movie: Each trilogy links to its 3 constituent movies
2. Movie → Trilogy: Shared movies link back to all trilogies they appear in

This creates interesting network clusters around:
- Movies like "Dazed and Confused" (appears in 4 trilogies)
- Movies like "Apocalypse Now" (bridging Vietnam-themed trilogies)
- Movies like "The Martian" (bridging space/survival/actor themes)

HOW TO USE
==========

1. Open in Obsidian:
   - Launch Obsidian
   - Click "Open vault folder as vault"
   - Select: /sessions/relaxed-determined-faraday/mnt/THREADS-VIZ/obsidian-vault

2. View the Graph:
   - Press Ctrl+G (or Cmd+G on Mac) to open Graph View
   - Interact with the force-directed graph
   - Click nodes to highlight connections
   - Use tags filter to show/hide node types

3. Explore Connections:
   - Click on shared movies like "Dazed and Confused"
   - See how it connects 4 different thematic contexts
   - Trace movie connections across trilogies
   - Find surprising thematic bridges

4. Recommended Graph Settings:
   - Force: 1.5-2.0 (increases spacing)
   - Center Force: 0.3 (prevents clustering at center)
   - Repel Force: -50 to -100 (repels nodes)
   - Link Force: 1.0 (default)
