## About

This project visualizes responses to a viral [Threads post](https://www.threads.com/@busse/post/DUGELJelUo6) asking users to share "logical trilogies that aren't actually trilogies" — groups of three thematically connected films that weren't intended as a series.

### What's a "Logical Trilogy"?

A logical trilogy is three movies that share thematic elements, narrative threads, or artistic connections — even though they were never meant to be a series. Examples include:

- **Cornetto Trilogy**: Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End
- **Guillermo del Toro's Spanish Civil War**: The Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth, The Spirit of the Beehive
- **Before Trilogy**: Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, Before Midnight
